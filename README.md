## Description

This is a webapp that helps you create matches for a bicycle party. A bicycle party is when groups of people bike accross town to eat meals together at different locations. Each group is assigned one meal to prepare in advance and host at their apartment. The webapp lets you upload information about each group and thereafter creates matches so each group hosts one meal and visits two other apartments.
